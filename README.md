# Machine_Learning_-Regression

This project is designed for the purpose of training and creating a Machine Learning model, with various stages involved:

  1. Data Access: In this initial phase, data is gathered and accessed to begin the modeling process.
  2. Data Cleaning: Data may contain inconsistencies or inaccuracies, and this step focuses on cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA involves a thorough examination of the dataset to understand its characteristics, patterns, and potential insights.
  4. Dataset Preprocessing: Prior to model development, the dataset is processed, which may include handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
  5. Training and Testing Dataset Split: The dataset is divided into two subsets â€“ a training set for model development and a testing set to assess its performance.
  6. Model Creation: This step involves the development and training of a regression model using the training dataset.
  7. Metric and Error Validation: Model performance is evaluated using relevant metrics and validation techniques to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This step provides insights into the model's ability to make predictions and its overall effectiveness.
